	<h2 style="color:blue">Artificial intelligence (AI)</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans
	 and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
	The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
	 A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to
	 new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured
	 data such as text, images, or video.</p>
	<h3>What is intelligence?</h3>
	<p style="font-size:20px">All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken
	 as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her
	 burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside.
	 The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside:
	 on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the 
	 ability to adapt to new circumstances.<br>

	Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.
	 Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.</p>
