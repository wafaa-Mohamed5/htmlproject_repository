<h1 style="text-align:center">How Artificial Intelligence (AI) Works?</h1>
<img src="AI.PNG" style="width:30%;">
<p style="font-size:20px">Building an AI system is a careful process of reverse-engineering human traits and capabilities in a machine,
 and using itâ€™s computational prowess to surpass what we are capable of. To understand How Aritificial Intelligence actually works,
 one needs to deep dive into the various sub domains of Artificial Intelligence and and understand how those domains
 could be applied into the various fields of the industry</p>
 <ul style="font-size:20px">
	 <li><h3>Machine Learning :</h3>
		 <p style="font-size:18.5px" >ML teaches a machine how to make inferences and decisions based on past experience.
		 It identifies patterns, analyses past data to infer the meaning of these data points to reach a possible conclusion without having to involve human experience. 
		 This automation to reach conclusions by evaluating data, 
		 saves a human time for businesses and helps them make a better decision.</p>
	 </li>
	 
	 <li><h3>Deep Learning : </h3>
		<p style="font-size:18.5px" >Deep Learning ia an ML technique. It teaches a machine to process inputs through layers in order to classify,
		infer and predict the outcome.</p>
	 </li>
		
	 <li><h3>Neural Networks :</h3>
	 <p style="font-size:18.5px" >Neural Networks work on the similar principles as of Human Neural cells. They are a series of algorithms that
		captures the relationship between various underying variabes and processes the data as a human brain does.</p>
	 </li>
	 
	 <li><h3>Natural Language Processing :</h3>
		<p style="font-size:18.5px">NLP is a science of reading, understanding, interpreting a language by a machine.
		Once a machine understands what the user intends to communicate, it responds accordingly.</p>
	 </li>
	 
	 <li><h3>Computer Vision :</h3>
	 <p style="font-size:18.5px"> Computer vision algorithms tries to understand an image by breaking down an image and studying different parts of the objects.
	 This helps the machine classify and learn from a set of images, to make a better output decision based on previous observations.</p>
	 </li>
	 
	 <li><h3>Cognitive Computing :</h3>
		<p style="font-size:18.5px">Cognitive computing algorithms try to mimic a human brain by anaysing text/speech/images/objects in a manner that a human does
		and tries to give the desired output.</p>
	 </li>

 </ul>
